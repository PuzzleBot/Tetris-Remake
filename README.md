# Tetris-Remake
A recreation of Tetris in Unity!


## Running the program
The game is still being worked on, using the Unity engine.

One way to run the program is to double-click "Tetris_Remake_Prototype.app".
This may not always be up-to-date, though.

Another way to compile and run the game is to open this
project in the Unity development client, and click the
play button at the top.

## Playing the game
Use asd as left, right, and down respectively. Use q and e to rotate left and right.

Standard tetris rules apply: fill rows with blocks to clear them.

(Lose and win conditions haven't been implemented yet)




## What's Implemented so far?

So far, the following features have been implemented:

* Tetris block generation
* Tetris block controls, minus the w key
* Tetris block gravity
* The basic playing field
* Row clearing
* Cleared row tracking
* A quit button (esc)


## What's Next?

* Implementing the w key, which should force the piece to 
the bottom of the play field
* Piece holding using the spacebar
* Win conditions (A scoring system)
* The lose condition (No more space to insert a new block)
* A pause menu
* An actual title screen
