# Tetris-Remake
A recreation of Tetris in Unity!


## Running the program
The game is still being worked on, using the Unity engine.

Builds of the game are found under Releases/
If there is more than one build, look for the one with the highest version number.

Another way to compile and run the game is to open this
project in the Unity development client, and click the
play button at the top.


## Playing the game
Use asd as left, right, and down respectively. Use q and e to rotate left and right.
Use p to pause, and press escape to quit.

Standard tetris rules apply: fill rows with blocks to clear them. Clear more lines at
once to get more points!

You lose if there is no more space for a new piece to enter the play area.
